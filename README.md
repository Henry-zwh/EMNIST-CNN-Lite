# EMNIST-CNN-Lite
A CNN network designed to achieve a single-kernel lensless optoelectronic fusion convolutional neural network.

****Features****

The conv1 layer of the CNN network uses a 3Ã—3 binarized convolution kernel, corresponding to a physical entity as a black-and-white mask template.  

The network has approximately 70k parameters, resulting in low computational complexity, making it suitable for embedded development and microcontroller integration.
